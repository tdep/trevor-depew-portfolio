## Portfolio Website

This is a small portfolio website that I am creating to host a number of projects I want to complete, but also demonstrate my experience and skills.

It will be deployed shortly and the link will be included here.

For now, it can be hosted locally using node and a json server.

The front-end is constructed entirely from the ground up using react.js and vanilla css.

There is a small json file hosting the data to populate the site, but that will change.

More to come!
